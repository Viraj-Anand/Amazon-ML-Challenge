First we removed PRODUCT_ID,TITLE,BULLET_POINTS,DESCRIPTION as we figured that PRODUCT's length is not related to it directly
and it is showing a direct relation with PRODUCT_ID_TYPE.

With remaining data we detected outliers and removed them using interquantile method.

We used "ROBUST SCALAR" to scale the data as it is not very much affected by outliers.

At first we tried RANDOMFOREST regressor,LINEAR regressior and XGboost but couldnt minimize the loss very much and the accurracy of the model was not up to the mark.

Finally we decided to build a neural network with the layering of (128*256*256*128) and fit thee data into it.
we trained the data for 20 epochs using ADAM optimiser and used mean absolute eerror for calculating loss.

After 20 epochs the training loss was 920.1493 and validation loss was 880.455.

Using the scoring metric given in the problem statement, we got a n accuracy of 96.2% on the test data.
