First we removed PRODUCT_ID,TITLE,BULLET_POINTS,DESCRIPTION as we figured that the target is not related to it directly
and they are showing a high correlation with PRODUCT_ID_TYPE.

With remaining data we detected outliers and removed them using interquantile method.

We used "ROBUST SCALAR" to scale the data as it is not very much affected by outliers.

At first we tried 'RANDOM FOREST' regressor,LINEAR regressor and XGboost but couldnt minimize the loss very much and the accurracy of the model was not up to the mark.

Finally we decided to build a neural network with the layering of (128X256X256X128) and fit the data into it.
we trained the data for 20 epochs using ADAM optimizer and used mean absolute error for calculating loss.

After 20 epochs the training loss was 920.1493 and validation loss was 880.455.

Using the scoring metric given in the problem statement, we got an accuracy of 96.2% on the test data.
